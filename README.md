## Deep Information Mining Network for Person Re-identification for ICASSP2024
### Model details.
We initially horizontally divide the human images into equal segments, ranging from 2 to 6 segments. Two segments represent the relationship between the upper and lower body parts and the entire body. Three segments represent the relationships between the head and chest, waist and abdomen, legs, and the entire body. Four segments represent the relationships between the head and neck, chest and abdomen, thighs, calves, and the entire body. Five segments represent the relationships between the head and neck, chest, abdomen, thighs, calves, and the entire body. Lastly, six segments represent the relationships between the head, chest, abdomen, thighs, calves, feet, and the entire body. For each segmented part, we thoroughly compute the corresponding relationships to fully exploit the information in the human image.
